# Shinkiro Asset Library
This directory contains the source code for Shinkiro's asset module.

All source code included in this directory is needed in order to pack assets into a bundle and to unpack a bundle into its collective assets.

## Recommended Usage
We strongly recommend using this module to dynamically grab previously packed asset bundles and unpack them into memory when any Shinkiro application is launched.
