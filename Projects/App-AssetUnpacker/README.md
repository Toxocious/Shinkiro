# Shinkiro Asset Unpacker
This directory contains the source code for Shinkiro's asset unpacker.

When built, simply place your previously packed `AssetBundles/` folder inside of the built asset unpacker directory and run the executable.

If the asset packing succeeds, you will find a new directory named `UnpackedAssets/` inside of the executable's directory which will contain all files from the asset bundle unpacked.

> Asset bundles are not currently obfuscated or encrypted, though it is being considered down the line.
